your job is to write a program to solve all the coil levels up to the final, which is 2000 by 2000 large. this will require a series of very clever algorithms to solve all the coil levels up to the final, which is 2000 by 2000 large. this directory contains detailed information including a sample brute force solver and some debugging and verifying tools. the brute force program can't even solve boards close to 1% of the final size in reasonable time. the final solution must run in under an hour. you will need to try ideas, test, iterate, many times. make a long term plan that assumes this is going to be hard and there will be repeated continuations to work on this until it is solved. do not stop until you have tested a final solution that works for the hardest level.
